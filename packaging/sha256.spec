"""PyInstaller spec for the portable build (day 16, D4).

    uv run pyinstaller packaging/sha256.spec --noconfirm

Produces ``dist/sha256/`` with ``sha256.exe`` and its libraries; the
``scripts/build_exe.py`` wrapper runs this and then lays ``avatars/``,
``models/`` and ``configs/`` beside the executable (the portable layout
``AppPaths.portable_root`` looks for), writes the guide in, and zips it.

What is *not* in the executable, on purpose: the model weights (1.2 GB of
LivePortrait plus the face landmarker; fetched by the scripts, copied by the
wrapper), the avatars (owner data), the configuration (the machine's own).

The fast engine (2026-10-09, ``sha256.avatar.liveportrait_tensorrt``): when
the ``tensorrt`` package is in this environment, its runtime DLL, the plugin
library and the ONNX parser (the three the bindings module links -- without
any one of them ``import tensorrt`` fails) and the builder resources for the
GPU families whose engine is built on the user's machine (RTX 30 and 40:
sm86, sm89) go into ``_internal/tensorrt_libs``, where the package's own
loader finds them. The RTX 50 family (sm120) needs no builder: its engine,
built here, travels under ``models/tensorrt`` (the wrapper). The other
builder resources (data-centre and older families, 2.5 GB that PyInstaller's
TensorRT hook would otherwise collect whole) are filtered out of the
binaries below; such a card runs the torch networks. The ONNX exporter's
packages (``onnx``, ``onnxscript``) stay out too: the export travels as a
file.
